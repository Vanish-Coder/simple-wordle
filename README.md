# simple-wordle
This is a remake of the classic Wordle. It runs entirely on a java JFrame (through a terminal window). No real purpose of it lol.

(I should also point out that the StdDraw file is not made by me (it is a Java library package).)


# Guide (step by step):

## Downloading:
To download the game, just tap on the green code button at the top, navigate to the "Local" tab on the top, and then press on "Download Zip". This will give you a zip file with all the code.


## Playing the Game:

### To play the game, do the following: 
1. Go to the shell on your laptop.
2. Go to the directory with the code inside it (to do so, use the command: cd [file directory info]).
   - For example, assuming my game files were stored in Simple Wordle, in a manner like this, I would use the command cd desktop/SimpleWordle:

3. Next compile all the files using the command: javac *.java (It may show some warnings, but those are just because of some archaic methods the StdDraw.java file is, it won't be a problem).
4. Next run the game with the command: java Wordle
- A window should pop up that looks like this:
